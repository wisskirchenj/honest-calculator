# IDEA EDU Course ...

Implemented in the Track 'SQL with Python' of hyperskill.org's JetBrains Academy.

## Technology / External Libraries

- Python 3.10.8,
- with packages: scikit-learn, tox, black and isort

## Repository Contents

The sources of main project tasks (5 stages) and testing.

## Program description

The toy project represents the realization of a calculator "game" given in flowcharts, which
increasingly checks user input and evaluates, if the calculation is necessary.
It's kind of nice to decompose a flowchart into python function logic - but late stages suffer
from really stupid textual logic... -> "honestly not my cup of tea this project"

Have fun!

## Project completion

Project was completed on 23.10.22.

## Progress

19.10.22 Project started - gitHub repo and project structure setup.

19.10.22 stage 1 completed - check for simple calculation term syntax.

19.10.22 stage 2 completed - perform the operation requested.

22.10.22 stage 3 completed - implement a memory and further branching, structure the code into functions, avoid globals.

23.10.22 stage 4 completed - lazy-check = some stupid messages on special calculation input -> not funny...

23.10.22 Final stage 5 completed - one-digit store memory check = more stupid questions -> also not funny...
